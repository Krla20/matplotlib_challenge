#### 1.  By removing duplicates the total number of mice reduced by only one from 249 to 248 mice.
#### 2. The bar graph showed the Drug Regimen Capomulin has the maximum mice number with a total of 230, followed very closely by the Ramicane with 228 and Propriva has the smaller number with 148 mice. 
#### 3. The data a slight difference in quantity of mice by gender  since it showed a total of 123 female mice and 125 male mice.
#### 4.  From the selected treatments Capomulin and Ramicane are more effective reducing the size of tumors.
#### 5. With treatment Capomulin the correlation between mouse weight, and average tumor volume is 0.84. It is a strong positive correlation, when the mouse weight increases the average tumor volume also increases.
#### 6. The regression analysis helped to understand how much the average tumor volume (dependent variable) will change when weight of mice change (independent variables) with the Capomulin treatment. The R-squared value is 0.71, which means 71% the model fit the data, wich is fairely good to predict the data from the model.  *(If you analyze a physical process and have very good measurements, you might expect R-squared values over 90%).*
